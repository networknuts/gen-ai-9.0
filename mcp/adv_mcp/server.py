CUSTOMER REFUND POLICY

1. Damaged products
Customers are eligible for a full refund when the product arrives damaged.
The customer must report the damage within 7 days of delivery.

2. Lost shipments
A shipment marked as lost in transit is eligible for a full refund after
the shipment has been delayed for at least 7 days.

3. Delayed shipments
A delayed shipment is not automatically eligible for a refund.
A refund may be approved if the shipment remains undelivered for more than
7 days after the expected delivery date.

4. Delivered products
Products may be returned within 30 days of delivery if they are unused and
in their original packaging.

5. Non-refundable charges
Express-delivery charges are non-refundable unless the shipment was lost.

6. Refund processing
Approved refunds are returned to the original payment method within
5 to 7 business days.
